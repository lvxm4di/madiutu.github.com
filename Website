<body bg-color="PINK"> 
  The Industrial Revolution marked a turning point in history,
  changing agriculture society to a highly industrialized community. 
  The growth of industry in several communities created competition,
  leading to transitions from the traditional way of life to a highly modern style. 
  
Manchester was just a small town in northern England in the early eighteenth 
century. A hundred years later, it had turned to the fastest - growing city in 
history. To contemporaries, it was both a marvel and a horror. Manchester's rise 
as a large industrial city was a result of what historians called the Industrial 
Revolution, the most profound transformation in human life since the beginnings
of agriculture. The revolution involved dramatic innovations in manufacturing,
mining, transportation, and communications and equally rapid changes in society and 
commerce. The introduction of new technologies and new social and economic 
arrangements allowed the industrializing countries, first, Britain, then Western 
Europe and the United States to unleash massive increases in production and productiviy, 
expolit the world's nataural resources as never before, and transform the environment and human 
life in unprecedented ways.
